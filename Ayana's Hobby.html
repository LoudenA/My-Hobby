<h1>Reading</h1>

<h2>Favorite Books</h2>

<p>I have always enjoyed reading. I first took a liking to books when my 
mother taught me how to read. We started out with the simple kiddy 
books (obviously), but I noticed that I enjoyed the feel of being able
to read something that wasn't particulary reality, which sparked my
interest in fantasy books. Once I got older and was able to actually
fully read, I looked into Harry Potter. To this day, Harry Potter
is my favorite series.</p>

<p>I have also thoroughly enjoyed the Alex Rider series. This series includes
a teenage boy named Alex Rider (hence the title),
who was considered
a spy and went on several adventures. I began reading this series back in
middle school. I later decided to continue the series and finish it 
later in high school.</p>

<h3>Reading Bucket List</h3>
 <p>There are many books that I have not read yet. I have already
read many adventure and fantasy books. Although I am not a huge
fan of non-fiction books, I would like to try to spark an interest
in them. For my non-fiction book, I will try to read 
<a href="http://laurahillenbrandbooks.com/">Unbroken</a>. </p>

<p>The next part of my reading bucket list is to finish the 
<a href="https://www.scholastic.com/corneliafunke/ink_trilogy.htm">Inkheart</a> series.
I began the series when I was in middle school, but I never finished it. I have been 
trying to finish up the second book of the trilogy. My goal is to finish it 
by the end of October.</p>
